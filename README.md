# Generative AI 🚀

Welcome to my **Generative AI** repository. This repo documents my step-by-step journey from scratch as I explore and understand the core concepts, tools, and frameworks that power modern Generative AI systems.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

This repository includes practical notebooks, tutorials, and notes on key GenAI concepts such as:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** – Understanding how LLMs work, tokenization, transformer architecture, and more.
- **Prompt Engineering** – Crafting prompts to get better responses from language models.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – Combining LLMs with external knowledge sources for more grounded and accurate outputs.
- **LangChain & Agents** – Creating intelligent agents and tool-using models for complex tasks.
- **Open-Source Models** – Working with models like LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma, etc., including setup, inference, and fine-tuning.

## 🧠 Why This Repository?

Generative AI is transforming the way we build intelligent applications. By maintaining this repository:

- I document what I learn in a structured and reusable format.
- Others can follow along or refer to specific parts for their own learning.
- It acts as a portfolio to demonstrate my understanding and practical skills in GenAI.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- HuggingFace Transformers
- OpenAI/Gemini API
- LangChain
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (as needed)
